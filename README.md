# SRCPLZ

SRCPLZ's goal is to be your one stop for sources for and against arguments you might encounter. Never get caught empty ended when someone is making a dubious claim!

The project will feature an easy to use editor to create your own source sheets, an efficient tag based search engine and sophisticated moderation to ensure the quality of the sheets
